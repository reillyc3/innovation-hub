I"Q<h1>what we’re all about</h1>

<p>We are a network of small, what we call, <strong><em>innovation hubs</em></strong>. The goal is to give kids around the world access to the tools and technology that isn’t readily available otherwise.</p>

<p>The majority of the children we serve are those in rural areas with limited access to electricity, the internet, and computers and/or tablets.</p>

<p>Our hubs are multi-purpose at their core. Come in and read on one of our Amazon Kindle e-readers, research for a school project on a chromebook, or hold a study session with your classmates.</p>
