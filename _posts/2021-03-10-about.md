# what we're all about

We are a network of small, what we call, ***innovation hubs***. The goal is to give kids around the world access to the tools and technology that isn't readily available otherwise. 

The majority of the children we serve are those in rural areas with limited access to electricity, the internet, and computers and/or tablets. 

Our hubs are multi-purpose at their core. Come in and read on one of our Amazon Kindle e-readers, research for a school project on a chromebook, or hold a study session with your classmates.
